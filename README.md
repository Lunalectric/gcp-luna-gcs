[![cnspec Security Scanning](https://github.com/lunalectric/gcp-luna-gcs/actions/workflows/terraform.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Lunalectric/gcp-luna-gcs/actions/workflows/terraform.yaml?query=workflow%3Aterraform)

This repository provides working examples of using [cnspec](https://cnspec.io) by [Mondoo](https://mondoo.com) as part of a production engineering workflow in order to find and fix security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations before they reach production.

The patterns in this repository are also closely related to [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/). 

## What is Platform Engineering?

Platform engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era. Platform engineers provide an integrated product most often referred to as an “Internal Developer Platform” covering the operational necessities of the entire lifecycle of an application.

The practice revolves around a standard workflow from a developer's laptop where change starts, through CI, CD, and on into runtime.
